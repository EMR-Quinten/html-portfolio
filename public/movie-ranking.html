<h1>The best movies according to Quinten</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>I love the emotion given in the movie and the friendship 2 inmates have.</p>
<h3>Intouchables</h3>
<p>The best part is that Philippe doesn't want to be treated as a handicapped person and wants to have a friend</p>
<h3>Coach Carter</h3>
<p>This movie describes the problem with the school system and the culture around sports while still being a beautiful movie about colaboration and about thinking for yourself</p>
